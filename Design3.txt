			PAGE TABLE MANAGEMENT
			=====================

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A1: In a few paragraphs, describe the existing code for locating the
>> frame, if any, that contains the data of a given page.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A2: When two user processes both need a new frame at the same time,
>> how are races avoided?

		       PAGING TO AND FROM DISK
		       =======================

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B1: When a frame is required but none is free, some frame must be
>> evicted.  Describe the algorithm used to choose a frame to evict.

>> B2: Explain your heuristic for deciding whether a page fault for an
>> invalid virtual address should cause the stack to be extended into
>> the page that faulted.

			 MEMORY MAPPED FILES
			 ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> C1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> C2: Describe how memory mapped files integrate into your virtual
>> memory subsystem.  Explain how the page fault and eviction
>> processes differ between swap pages and other pages.

>> C3: Explain how you determine whether a new file mapping overlaps
>> any existing segment.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> C4: Mappings created with "mmap" have similar semantics to those of
>> data demand-paged from executables, except that "mmap" mappings are
>> written back to their original files, not to swap.  This implies
>> that much of their implementation can be shared.  Explain why your
>> implementation either does or does not share much of the code for
>> the two situations.
