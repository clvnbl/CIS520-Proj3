			PAGE TABLE MANAGEMENT
			=====================

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A1: In a few paragraphs, describe the existing code for locating the
>> frame, if any, that contains the data of a given page.

There is a member for all the page structs, and physical data is stored in the frame struct. There is a pointer variable for the virtual
address of te kernel in the frame struct, this pointer holds the page it owns, and the rest of the physical data. frame_alloc_and_lock()
in frame.c to allocate the frame, in this function it does the work of locating which frame in memory to use. It first checks if 
there are any available frames and if not, it must clear one to be used. 

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A2: When two user processes both need a new frame at the same time,
>> how are races avoided?

The scan_lock function makes sure that only one process can access a particular frame by checking the lock value of the frame's
struct to see if it is being used. 

		       PAGING TO AND FROM DISK
		       =======================

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B1: When a frame is required but none is free, some frame must be
>> evicted.  Describe the algorithm used to choose a frame to evict.

try_frame_allooc_and_lock() in frame.c checks to see which frame has been used the least so that it can take over that one.

>> B2: Explain your heuristic for deciding whether a page fault for an
>> invalid virtual address should cause the stack to be extended into
>> the page that faulted.



			 MEMORY MAPPED FILES
			 ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> C1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> C2: Describe how memory mapped files integrate into your virtual
>> memory subsystem.  Explain how the page fault and eviction
>> processes differ between swap pages and other pages.

>> C3: Explain how you determine whether a new file mapping overlaps
>> any existing segment.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> C4: Mappings created with "mmap" have similar semantics to those of
>> data demand-paged from executables, except that "mmap" mappings are
>> written back to their original files, not to swap.  This implies
>> that much of their implementation can be shared.  Explain why your
>> implementation either does or does not share much of the code for
>> the two situations.
